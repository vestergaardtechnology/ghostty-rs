///
///   - In no case shall the HarfBuzz client modify memory that is passed to
///     HarfBuzz in a blob. If there is any such possibility,
///     HB_MEMORY_MODE_DUPLICATE should be used such that HarfBuzz makes a
///     copy immediately,
///
///   - Use HB_MEMORY_MODE_READONLY otherwise, unless you really really really
///     know what you are doing,
///
///   - HB_MEMORY_MODE_WRITABLE is appropriate if you really made a copy of
///     data solely for the purpose of passing to HarfBuzz and doing that
///     just once (no reuse!),
///
///   - If the font is mmap()ed, it's okay to use
///     HB_MEMORY_READONLY_MAY_MAKE_WRITABLE , however, using that mode
///     correctly is very tricky. Use HB_MEMORY_MODE_READONLY instead.
