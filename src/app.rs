//! Port of `src/App.zig`.
//!
//! STATUS: ported
//!
//! App is the primary GUI application for ghostty. This builds the window,
//! sets up the renderer, etc. The primary run loop is started by calling
//! the "run" function.
//!
//! Deviations:
//! * [`App::create`] returns a `Box` (Zig returns a stable `*App`); the
//!   mailbox queue is a field of the boxed app like in Zig.
//! * `Mailbox.Queue` is [`MailboxQueue`]; `Message.NewWindow` and
//!   `Message.OpenConfig` are [`NewWindow`] and [`OpenConfig`].
//! * Errors are the core surface [`Error`] (an anyhow-like wrapper) since
//!   the app forwards surface errors.
//! * `std.Io.Timestamp` (awake clock) is [`Instant`].
//! * The wasm API (`Wasm`, an empty struct on non-wasm targets with only
//!   commented-out code) has no counterpart.
//! * The font discovery and render device warmup threads are only spawned
//!   where those decls exist in Zig (CoreText / Metal, i.e. macOS); the
//!   Linux backends have none.
