//! Port of `src/apprt/action.zig`.
//!
//! STATUS: ported
//!
//! Deviations:
//! * Payloads that borrow strings (`[:0]const u8` / `[]const u8` in Zig)
//!   borrow them in Rust too, so [`Action`] has a lifetime. NUL-terminated
//!   strings that cross the C ABI as `[*:0]const u8` are `&CStr`.
//! * Zig computes `Action.CValue` at comptime from the payload types; the
//!   Rust port generates the enum, its C tag enum, the `#[repr(C)]` value
//!   union and `cval()` from one list with a local macro. `Action.Value(key)`
//!   (a comptime type function) has no Rust counterpart: use the variant's
//!   payload type directly.
//! * Non-exhaustive C enums (`GotoTab`, `ColorKind`) are transparent
//!   `c_int` newtypes with associated constants for the named values.
//! * `InitialSize.getGObjectType` (GObject boxed registration) is skipped;
//!   the GTK apprt registers its own GObject types.
//! * Zig's `format` methods are `Display` impls.
//! * [`Target::Surface`] holds a raw pointer like Zig's `*CoreSurface`.
//!
//! Stand-ins for types from files that are not ported yet live in the
//! [`standin`] module (marked `TODO(port-dedupe)`).

// A GUIDE TO ADDING NEW ACTIONS:
//
// 1. Add the action to the `Key` enum. The order of the enum matters
//    because it maps directly to the libghostty C enum. For ABI
//    compatibility, new actions should be added to the end of the enum.
//
// 2. Add the action and optional value to the Action union.
//
// 3. If the value type is not void, ensure the value is C ABI
//    compatible (extern). If it is not, add a `C` decl to the value
//    and a `cval` function to convert to the C ABI compatible value.
//
// 4. Update `include/ghostty.h`: add the new key, value, and union
//    entry. If the value type is void then only the key needs to be
//    added. Ensure the order matches exactly with the Zig code.
//
// (In the Rust port, steps 1-2 are a single entry in the list below.)
