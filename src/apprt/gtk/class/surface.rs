//! Port of `src/apprt/gtk/class/surface.zig`.
//!
//! STATUS: ported
//!
//! Rust notes:
//! * The core surface is reached through a raw pointer like Zig
//!   (`core_surface: ?*CoreSurface`); it is created in `init_surface` and
//!   freed in finalize (the `Drop` of the private struct).
//! * The apprt surface handed to the core lives in the private struct
//!   (`rt_surface`), which has a stable address for the object's lifetime.
//! * Enum properties use GObject enum mirrors registered under the Zig
//!   type names ([`MouseShape`] = `GhosttyMouseShape`, [`ClipboardType`] =
//!   `GhosttyApprtClipboard`); the mouse shape nicks are the CSS cursor names.
//! * Clipboard reads keep the surface alive by moving a strong reference
//!   into the async callbacks (Zig: `self.ref()` in the userdata).
//! * The Kitty clipboard read operation state is a heap struct moved
//!   between the async callbacks (Zig: `KittyReadOp`).
