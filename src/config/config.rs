//! Port of `src/config/Config.zig`.
//!
//! STATUS: ported
//!
//! Config is the main config struct. These fields map directly to the
//! CLI flag names hence we use a lot of `as "..."` syntax to support hyphens.
//!
//! Pandoc is used to automatically generate manual pages and other forms of
//! documentation, so documentation comments on fields in the Config struct
//! should use Pandoc's flavor of Markdown.
//!
//! For a reference to Pandoc's Markdown see their [online
//! manual.](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown)
//!
//! # Port notes
//!
//! * The struct is defined with [`cli_struct!`], which generates the field
//!   reflection Zig gets from `@typeInfo(Config)`: parsing
//!   ([`Fields::parse_into_field`]), formatting ([`FormatFields`]), change
//!   detection ([`ChangedFields`]) and the help strings ([`Fields::FIELDS`]).
//!   The field order is the order of [`Key`](super::key::Key).
//! * The arena (`_arena`) is dropped: every value owns its memory, so
//!   `deinit` is a no-op and `shallowClone` is a deep clone.
//! * `Config.default(alloc)` is the inherent [`Config::default`] (it adds the
//!   default keybinds, command palette entries and URL link). The derived
//!   [`Default`] trait impl only holds the raw field defaults (Zig `.{}`).
//! * `Config.clone(alloc)` is the inherent [`Config::clone`]; it shadows
//!   the derived `Clone::clone`.
//! * The replay iterator (`Replay.Iterator`) needs to mutate the config it
//!   is replaying into while `cli.args.parse` also holds it. In Rust the
//!   replay loop is [`Config::load_replay`], which feeds each replayed
//!   argument to `cli.args.parse` and handles `-e` itself.

        /// QWERTY keyboard, but will match the `q` key on a AZERTY keyboard
        /// (assuming US physical layout).

        /// the modifiers don't match!). More details on impossible key combinations
        /// can be found at this excellent source written by Qt developers:
        /// https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qkeysequence.html#keyboard-layout-issues

        /// keyboard regardless of the keyboard layout. These are case-sensitive.
        ///
        /// For aesthetic reasons, the w3c codes also support snake case. For
        /// example, `key_a` is equivalent to `KeyA`. The only exceptions are
        /// function keys, e.g. `F1` is `f1` (no underscore). This is a consequence
        /// of our internal code using snake case but is purposely supported
        /// and tested so it is safe to use. It allows an all-lowercase binding
        /// which I find more aesthetically pleasing.
        ///
        /// Function keys such as `insert`, `up`, `f5`, etc. are also specified
        /// using the keys as specified by the previously linked W3C specification.

        /// Physical keys always match with a higher priority than Unicode codepoints,
        /// so if you specify both `a` and `KeyA`, the physical key will always be used
        /// regardless of what order they are configured.
        ///
        /// The special key `catch_all` can be used to match any key that is not
        /// otherwise bound. This can be combined with modifiers, for example
        /// `ctrl+catch_all` will match any key pressed with `ctrl` that is not
        /// otherwise bound. When looking up a binding, Ghostty first tries to match
        /// `catch_all` with modifiers. If no match is found and the event has
        /// modifiers, it falls back to `catch_all` without modifiers.
        ///
        /// Valid modifiers are `shift`, `ctrl` (alias: `control`), `alt` (alias: `opt`,
        /// `option`), and `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`). You may use the modifier
        /// or the alias. When debugging keybinds, the non-aliased modifier will always
        /// be used in output.
        ///
        /// Note: The fn or "globe" key on keyboards are not supported as a
        /// modifier. This is a limitation of the operating systems and GUI toolkits
        /// that Ghostty uses.
        ///
        /// Some additional notes for triggers:
        ///
        ///   * modifiers cannot repeat, `ctrl+ctrl+a` is invalid.
        ///
        ///   * modifiers and keys can be in any order, `shift+a+ctrl` is *weird*,

        ///   * only a single key input is allowed, `ctrl+a+b` is invalid.
        ///
        /// You may also specify multiple triggers separated by `>` to require a

        ///
        ///   * If a prefix in a sequence is previously bound, the sequence will
        ///     override the previous binding. For example, if `ctrl+a` is bound to
        ///     `new_window` and `ctrl+a>n` is bound to `new_tab`, pressing `ctrl+a`

        ///
        ///    Available since: 1.1.0
        ///
        /// Keybind triggers are not unique per prefix combination. For example,

        /// Multiple prefixes can be specified. For example,
        /// `global:unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config` will make the keybind global
        /// and not consume the input to reload the config.

        ///  - GNOME since [48](https://release.gnome.org/48/#and-thats-not-all) with

        ///
        /// ## Chained Actions
        ///
        /// A keybind can have multiple actions by using the `chain` keyword for
        /// subsequent actions. When a keybind is activated, all chained actions are
        /// executed in order. The syntax is:
        ///
        /// ```ini
        /// keybind = ctrl+a=new_window
        /// keybind = chain=goto_split:left
        /// ```
        ///
        /// This binds `ctrl+a` to first open a new window, then move focus to the
        /// left split. Each `chain` entry appends an action to the most recently
        /// defined keybind. You can chain as many actions as you want:
        ///
        /// ```ini
        /// keybind = ctrl+a=new_window
        /// keybind = chain=goto_split:left
        /// keybind = chain=toggle_fullscreen
        /// ```
        ///
        /// Chained actions cannot have prefixes like `global:` or `unconsumed:`.
        /// The flags from the original keybind apply to the entire chain.
        ///
        /// Chained actions work with key sequences as well. For example:
        ///
        /// ```ini
        /// keybind = ctrl+a>n=new_window
        /// keybind = chain=goto_split:left
        /// ````
        ///
        /// Chains with key sequences apply to the most recent binding in the
        /// sequence.
        ///
        /// Chained keybinds are available since Ghostty 1.3.0.
        ///
        /// ## Key Tables
        ///
        /// You may also create a named set of keybindings known as a "key table."
        /// A key table must be explicitly activated for the bindings to become
        /// available. This can be used to implement features such as a
        /// "copy mode", "vim mode", etc. Generically, this can implement modal
        /// keyboard input.
        ///
        /// Key tables are defined using the syntax `<table>/<binding>`. The
        /// `<binding>` value is everything documented above for keybinds. The
        /// `<table>` value is the name of the key table. Table names can contain
        /// anything except `/`, `=`, `+`, and `>`. The characters `+` and `>` are
        /// reserved for keybind syntax (modifier combinations and key sequences).
        /// For example `foo/ctrl+a=new_window` defines a binding within a table
        /// named `foo`.
        ///
        /// Tables are activated and deactivated using the binding actions
        /// `activate_key_table:<name>` and `deactivate_key_table`. Other table
        /// related binding actions also exist; see the documentation for a full list.
        /// These are the primary way to interact with key tables.
        ///
        /// Binding lookup proceeds from the innermost table outward, so keybinds in
        /// the default table remain available unless explicitly unbound in an inner
        /// table.
        ///
        /// A key table has some special syntax and handling:
        ///
        ///   * `<name>/` (with no binding) defines and clears a table, resetting all
        ///     of its keybinds and settings.
        ///
        ///   * You cannot activate a table that is already the innermost table; such
        ///     attempts are ignored. However, the same table can appear multiple times
        ///     in the stack as long as it is not innermost (e.g., `A -> B -> A -> B`
        ///     is valid, but `A -> B -> B` is not).
        ///
        ///   * A table can be activated in one-shot mode using
        ///     `activate_key_table_once:<name>`. A one-shot table is automatically
        ///     deactivated when any non-catch-all binding is invoked.
        ///
        ///   * Key sequences work within tables: `foo/ctrl+a>ctrl+b=new_window`.
