//! Port of `src/font/shaper/web_canvas.zig`.
//!
//! STATUS: ported (wasm32-only; not compiled on Linux, so this has never
//! been compiled.)
//!
//! Port notes: the Zig file predates several refactors (it reads
//! `opts.cell_buf`, which `shape.Options` no longer has, uses the removed
//! `run.group.group.faceFromIndex` and the old `Terminal`/`GroupCache`
//! APIs in `Wasm.shaper_test`). This port keeps the logic: the cell buffer
//! is passed to `init` explicitly, the face is fetched through the run's
//! shared grid, and `shaper_test` is written against the current APIs.
