//! Port of `src/renderer/message.zig`.
//!
//! STATUS: ported
//!
//! Deviations: payloads that Zig allocates (the derived configs, the
//! arena-backed search matches) are owned values (`Box`/`Vec`) freed on
//! drop; `deinit` consumes the message. The font grid pointers stay raw
//! pointers like in Zig (they are reference counted by the grid set).
//!
//! Stand-in for `terminal.highlight.Flattened` lives in [`standin`]
//! (TODO(port-dedupe)).
