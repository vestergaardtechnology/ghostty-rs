//! Port of `src/renderer/State.zig`.
//!
//! STATUS: ported
//!
//! This is the render state that is given to a renderer.
//!
//! Deviations:
//! * `std.Io.Mutex` is [`crate::lib::tinyio::Mutex`] and `std.Io` is
//!   [`TinyIo`]. The mutex, terminal and inspector are raw pointers like in
//!   Zig: the owner (the core surface) keeps them alive for the lifetime of
//!   the state.
//! * `Preedit.codepoints` is an owned `Vec` (Zig: an allocated slice with
//!   explicit `deinit`/`clone`).
//!
//! A stand-in for the inspector lives in [`standin`]
//! (TODO(port-dedupe)).
