//! Port of `src/terminal/kitty/graphics_storage.zig`.
//!
//! STATUS: ported
//!
//! Notes on the port:
//! - Functions that take a `*Screen` in Zig only touch `screen.pages`, so
//!   they take `&mut PageList`/`&PageList` here (the storage is a field of
//!   the screen, so borrowing the whole screen is impossible in Rust).
//! - Functions that take a `*Terminal` in Zig take the active screen's
//!   `&mut PageList` plus a [`TerminalInfo`] holding the terminal values
//!   they read (geometry, scrolling region and the active screen's cursor),
//!   for the same reason. `Placement`'s geometry methods take only the
//!   `TerminalInfo`.
//! - `std.Io`/allocator parameters are dropped.
//! - The image and placement maps are `HashMap`s. Zig removes entries while
//!   iterating; the port collects the matching keys first and then removes
//!   them in the same order, which is equivalent because no removal changes
//!   whether a later entry matches.
//! - `imageById`/`imageByNumber` return `Option<&Image>` instead of an
//!   `Image` copy (Rust images own their pixels).
//! - `PendingImage::complete`/`complete_frame` return the data back in
//!   `Err` instead of returning `false` (the caller keeps ownership).
//! - `ScrollMargins::end` takes the page list (Zig keeps a `*Screen`).
