//! Port of `src/terminal/stream_terminal.zig`.
//!
//! STATUS: ported
//!
//! Port notes / deviations:
//! - `Handler` holds `&'a mut Terminal` (Zig: `*Terminal`). Tests that
//!   inspect the terminal while a stream is alive go through
//!   `s.handler.terminal`.
//! - Effects are plain function pointers taking `&mut Handler`, like Zig.
//!   Callbacks that need state use statics/thread-locals or recover their
//!   embedder from the handler (Zig uses `@fieldParentPtr` the same way).
//! - Clipboard read/write replies (`ClipboardReadState`,
//!   `KittyClipboardReadState`, `KittyClipboardWriteReplyState`): the
//!   reply state does not hold a pointer back to the handler (that would
//!   alias the `&mut Handler` the callback holds). A reply encodes its
//!   response (and notes a requested grant) in the state, and the handler
//!   applies it as soon as the callback returns. The bytes written and the
//!   grants recorded are the same; only a write the callback itself makes
//!   to the pty after replying is ordered before the reply.
//! - `paste` encodes into a buffer and then streams it to `write_pty` in
//!   `PASTE_CHUNK_SIZE` chunks (Zig streams through a buffered `PtyWriter`
//!   whose drain calls `write_pty`; the chunks are identical because the
//!   writer always fills its buffer before draining). The paste encoder
//!   borrows the terminal and grants, which can't coexist with the
//!   `&mut Handler` that `write_pty` takes.
//! - `Terminal.io()` is represented by [`Handler::io`], the entropy source
//!   for Kitty paste event one-time passwords.
//! - Allocation failure is not recoverable in Rust. The tests that force
//!   allocation failures with a `FailingAllocator` use the [`VT_TW`]
//!   tripwire at the same allocation points instead.
