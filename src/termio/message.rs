//! Port of `src/termio/message.zig`.
//!
//! STATUS: ported
//!
//! Deviations: allocated payloads (`change_config`, `write_alloc`, the
//! Kitty clipboard grant password) are owned `Box`es freed on drop, so the
//! allocator fields are gone and `deinit` consumes the message. The
//! `write_*` variants hold the [`MessageData`] payload types directly.
//!
//! Stand-in for `terminal.Terminal.ScrollViewport` lives in [`standin`]
//! (TODO(port-dedupe)).
