//! Port of `src/termio/Thread.zig`.
//!
//! STATUS: ported
//!
//! Represents the "writer" thread for terminal IO. The reader side is
//! handled by the Termio struct itself and dependent on the underlying
//! implementation (i.e. if its a pty, manual, etc.).
//!
//! The writer thread does handle writing bytes to the pty but also handles
//! different events such as starting synchronized output, changing some
//! modes (like linefeed), etc. The goal is to offload as much from the
//! reader thread as possible since it is the hot path in parsing VT
//! sequences and updating terminal state.
//!
//! This thread state can only be used by one thread at a time.
//!
//! Deviations from the Zig code:
//! * The allocator field is dropped.
//! * The callback data is created by [`Thread::thread_main`] (Zig: by
//!   `threadMain_`) so that it outlives the drain loop that runs after an
//!   abnormal exit; that loop still has the wakeup and stop completions
//!   armed with it.
//! * The xev callbacks reach the loop through their `&mut Loop` argument
//!   rather than through `Thread.loop`, since the loop is borrowed by its
//!   own `run` while they execute.
//! * On an error, Zig replaces the terminal contents with an error
//!   message. The terminal is not ported yet, so the message is logged
//!   (TODO(port-dedupe): write it to the terminal once `Terminal` lands).
